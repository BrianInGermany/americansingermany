## Welcome Americans and Friends

**Join the conversation!**

We're currently a "klein aber fein" collection of around 130 folks organized on Slack, growing by the day. Our members from across the country post on a variety of expat-related topics in our main chat, as well as in our many channels for topics and locations.

Meet new friends, and join group chats for topics you're interested in, like #homeownership-and-renting, or for your own local area, like #frankfurt!

**What is Slack?**

If you've never used it, Slack is a messaging app for smartphone and computer that combines the spontaneity of a WhatsApp or Facebook group with the organizational advantages of a forum. All members are added to the #general channel on joining, and there are subchannels for topic-specific conversations and for local areas. Here is a [list of our current channels](https://americansingermany.club/channel_list).

- If you need to get your bearings, try this [Slack how-to](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-slack/)!


**Here is a quick summary of how our group works:**
- Sign up to get an email invite, then create an account.
- Post a hello message in the #general channel to introduce yourself.
- Browse the channels on the left pane, and join any topics you're into, or ask for one to be created.
- Tip: there are also desktop apps for [windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [mac](https://slack.com/downloads/mac) and [linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)
- Tip: if you want to meet folks fast, join the #chat-roulette channel, and be randomly matched in 4-way chats once a week.
  
**Community Rules:**
1. Use your common sense and have fun!
2. Check out #rules channel for details, questions or suggestions

**See you in Slack!**
