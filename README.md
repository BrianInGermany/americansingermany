## Welcome Americans and Friends!

Go to [join.americansingermany.club](http://join.americansingermany.club) to get involved with events for liberally inclined Americans across the country.

The Rhine-Main Area is currently the largest user base of this group, but it is growing by the day!

Meet new American friends and create group chats about topics you're interested in, or for your own local area!

Share the site with your friends. The possibilities are endless :)

If you need to get your bearings in Slack, try this [how-to](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-slack/)!

Here is a quick summary of how this Slack works:
- Post a hello message in the #general channel to introduce yourself
- Think about joining one of the existing channels for individual regions and cities.
- Or start your own, and invite new friends with the [invite link](http://join.americansingermany.club).

__Deutschsprachige sind auch herzlich willkommen. Viele von uns sprechen auch gerne Deutsch.__

See you in Slack!
