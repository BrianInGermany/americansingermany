## Welcome Americans and Friends!

**Go to <a href="http://join.americansingermany.club">http://join.americansingermany.club</a> to network and socialize with Americans in your area on Slack.**

We are currently a "klein aber fein" collection of around 100 folks, and we're growing by the day! We are organized on [Slack](http://slack.americansingermany.club) and [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Americans-in-Germany/). Our core user base is currently Rhein-Main (Frankfurt and surroundings), but we have folks in Berlin, Hamburg and elsewhere.

Meet new friends and create group chats about topics you're interested in, or for your own local area!

Share this site with your friends, organize events, have fun.

If you need to get your bearings in Slack, try this [how-to](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-slack/)!

**Here is a quick summary of how this Slack works:**
- Sign up for an account on this Slack via the join link at the top of the page.
- Post a hello message in the #general channel to introduce yourself.
- Think about joining one of the channels for individual cities, like #berlin.
- If you want to meet folks fast, join the #chat-roulette channel, and be randomly matched in 4-way chats once a week.
- Tip: there is also a [desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)
  
**Community Rules:**
1. Use your common sense.
2. No Trump fans (see rule number 1).

**See you in Slack!**
